# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.
- Asymptotic analysis finds a bound that applies for all values >= n so it doesn't tell us anything about complexity for input sizes less than n (unless using little o or little omega).
- Certain operations may be constant time and ignored in asymptotic analysis when the operations take a long time relative to many other operations in practice.
- The bounds can be very large in asymptotic analysis so two algorithms could be âˆˆ $theta$(n) but one could be 2n + 1 complexity while the other is 28n + 50 but in the notation they appear to be the same performance.


- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

  $log{n}$ to find in a binary tree
  
  $T(1,000)$ = $log{_2}{1000}$ = 3 / $log{2}$
  
  $T(10,000)$ = $log{_2}{10000}$ = 4 / $log{2}$

  $T(10000) / T(1000)$ = (4 / $log{2}$) / (3 / $log{2}$) = 4/3
  4/3 * 5 seconds = 6.66666 seconds

  I'd expect it to run in about 6.6666 seconds with 10,000 elements because it should be the original time by the ratio of T(10000) and T(1000).
  

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.
- The array size of 1000 was less than the lower bound on the theoretical time complexity so it shouldn't be applied.
- The larger array contained strings while the small array contained integers which are compared more quickly
- The computer had other intensive operations during the run with 10,000 elements so it had limited access to cpu resources resulting in longer execution time
